In this project we were a team of 3 students : 
- Mustapha Ajeghrir
- Nouamane Tazi
- Asmae Khald


The goal of this project was to create a decision system for sorting and classification by using the concepts of MR-sort and NCS.

## Simple example :
Imagine you are the responsible person for recruiting students in a prestigious university, your goal is to determine the right criteria of admission (to decide someone should enter or not). Let's consider the following example :

<!-- table 3x3 -->
<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Criteria</th>
      <th scope="col">Mathematics</th>
      <th scope="col">Physics</th>
      <th scope="col">Chemistry</th>
      <th scope="col">Language 1</th>
      <th scope="col">Language 2</th>
      <th scope="col">Results</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Student 1</th>
      <td>15</td>
      <td>15</td>
      <td>13</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>Good</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Student 2</th>
      <td>18</td>
      <td>14</td>
      <td>18</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>13</td>
      <td>Very Good</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Student 3</th>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>11</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>Bad</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Student 4</th>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>13</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>Very Bad</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The `Results` column is the result we want to predict for each student. Letâ€™s say, we can only know this label after few years after the entry in the university. So, it is better to know in prior which student will have good results.

## MR-sort :
To make it simple (otherwise, take a look at the report in the bottom of this page) : MR-sort is using a weighted sum based on accepted criteria. Let's say we have 5 criteria weighted $$0.2$$ each, and an acceptance threshold of $$0.7$$. In this case the student should get good results in at least $$4$$ criteria to be considered good $$( 4 \times 0.2 = 0.8 > 0.7)$$.

## Inv-MR-sort :
Is the task of inferring the MR-Sort rules from examples made by a decision maker. (Better definitions inside the report)

## NCS :
To make it simple (otherwise, take a look at the report in the bottom of this page) : NCS is using criteria coalitions to determine whether to accept or not. For example, we accept a student if he has more than $$12$$ in `Mathematics` and `Physics` and more than $$10$$ in `Chemistry`.

## Inv-NCS :
Is the task of inferring the NCS rules and coalitions from examples made by a decision maker. (Better definitions inside the report)
