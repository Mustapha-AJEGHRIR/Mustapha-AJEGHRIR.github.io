In this project we were a team of 3 students : 
- Mustapha Ajeghrir
- Nouamane Tazi
- Asmae Khald


The goal of this project was to create a decision system for sorting and classification by using the concepts of MR-sort and NCS.

## Simple example :
Imagine you are the responsible person for recruiting students in a prestigious university, your goal is to determine the right criteria of admission (to decide someone should enter or not). Let's consider the following example :


| Criteria      | Mathematics | Physics | Chemistry | Language 1 | Language 2 | Results 
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **Student 1**| 15 | 15 | 13 | 10 | 12 | Good |
| **Student 2**| 18 | 14 | 18 | 12 | 13 | Very Good |
| **Student 3**| 6 | 11 | 12 | 10 | 9 | Bad |
| **Student 4**| 5 | 7 | 12 | 13 | 4 | Very Bad |


The `Results` column is the result we want to predict for each student. Letâ€™s say, we can only know this label after few years after the entry in the university. So, it is better to know in prior which student will have good results.

## MR-sort :
To make it simple (otherwise, take a look at the report in the bottom of this page) : MR-sort is using a weighted sum based on accepted criteria. Let's say we have 5 criteria weighted $$0.2$$ each, and an acceptance threshold of $$0.7$$. In this case the student should get good results in at least $$4$$ criteria to be considered good $$( 4 \times 0.2 = 0.8 > 0.7)$$.

## Inv-MR-sort :
Is the task of inferring the MR-Sort rules from examples made by a decision maker using `linear programming` with `Gurobi`. (Better definitions inside the report)

## NCS :
To make it simple (otherwise, take a look at the report in the bottom of this page) : NCS is using criteria coalitions to determine whether to accept or not. For example, we accept a student if he has more than $$12$$ in `Mathematics` and `Physics` and more than $$10$$ in `Chemistry`.

## Inv-NCS :
Is the task of inferring the NCS rules and coalitions from examples made by a decision maker using `SAT` solvers like `Gophersat`. (Better definitions inside the report)
